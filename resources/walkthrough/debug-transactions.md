# Debug Transactions

To start debugging a transaction using the extension, open the command palette with `SHIFT + CMD + P` and select "Truffle: Debug Transaction".
The extension would list all the previously run transactions in chronological order.
Clicking on any transaction starts the debugging process,
and you can step through to gain more insight into that transaction.
